def print_menu(exits, room_items, inv_items):
    """This function displays the menu of available actions to the player. The
    argument exits is a dictionary of exits as exemplified in map.py. The
    arguments room_items and inv_items are the items lying around in the room
    and carried by the player respectively. The menu should, for each exit,
    call the function print_exit() to print the information about each exit in
    the appropriate format. The room into which an exit leads is obtained
    using the function exit_leads_to(). Then, it should print a list of commands
    related to items: for each item in the room print

    "TAKE <ITEM ID> to take <item name>."

    and for each item in the inventory print

    "DROP <ITEM ID> to drop <item name>."

    For example, the menu of actions available at the Reception may look like this:

    You can:
    GO EAST to your personal tutor's office.
    GO WEST to the parking lot.
    GO SOUTH to Robs' room.
    TAKE BISCUITS to take a pack of biscuits.
    TAKE HANDBOOK to take a student handbook.
    DROP ID to drop your id card.
    DROP LAPTOP to drop your laptop.
    DROP MONEY to drop your money.
    What do you want to do?

    """
    print("You can:")
    # Iterate over available exits
    for direction in exits:
        # Print the exit name and where it leads to
        print_exit(direction, exit_leads_to(exits, direction))

    #
    # COMPLETE ME!
    #

    print("What do you want to do?")
